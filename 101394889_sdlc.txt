Learning DevOps is crucial in the software development cycle because it
fosters collaboration, accelerates delivery, and improves software quality. By
automating processes like testing, deployment, and monitoring, DevOps
reduces manual work, enhances efficiency, and minimizes errors. It also
integrates security from the start, ensuring robust practices while enabling
teams to quickly adapt to changing market demands.
